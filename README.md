# Geo-RealESRGAN-Lite

This repository provides a minimal working example of the Geo-RealESRGAN model proposed in the manuscript:
**"Perception-Guided Deep Learning for High-Resolution Reconstruction of Sparse 3D Reservoir Property Models"**

## Features
- RRDB-based generator for geological image super-resolution
- Supports RGB-encoded geological attribute slices
- Minimal code to satisfy reproducibility and journal open-source requirements

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `torch`, `PIL`, `numpy`
2. Run:
   ```bash
   python main.py
